author: Myron Marston

As we [announced back in February](/blog/2017/02/now-in-beta-effective-testing-with-rspec-3/),
Ian Dees and I have written a new book for the Pragmatic Bookshelf
about RSpec, entitled _Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with Confidence_.
We're happy to announce that the book is out of beta and is now shipping from
[pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3) and
[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Testing-RSpec-Build-Confidence/dp/1680501984/).

We put a ton of work over the last three years into this project, distilling our
combined 20 years of testing experience into a book that explains how to do
TDD/BDD well using RSpec. We believe that anyone who wants to learn RSpec or
that regularly uses RSpec will benefit from the book. The early reviews from
our readers have been quite positive. Avdi Grimm, author of _Confident Ruby_ and
_Exceptional Ruby_ and Head Chef of [RubyTapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/), has this
to say about the book:

> Ruby embraces the old Lisp idea that you should “build up a language” to address your problem,
> and RSpec carries this approach into the world of testing. But RSpec is a big toolbox, and in
> order to harness its full power you need a guide. This is that guide: the bridge you need to
> take you from writing tests, to expressing your design requirements in code.
