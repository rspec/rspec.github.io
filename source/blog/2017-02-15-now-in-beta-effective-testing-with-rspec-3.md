title: "Now in Beta: Effective Testing with RSpec 3"
author: Myron Marston
---

Six years ago, [The RSpec Book](https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book)
introduced thousands of people to RSpec and helped them get the most out of the
framework. Since that time, RSpec has continued to evolve. RSpec 3 brought many
changes to help developers build and test better Ruby programs. The RSpec Book,
now quite out of date, does not cover these changes.  Readers have been
asking: _is there going to be a new book?_

In fact, [Ian Dees](https://twitter.com/undees) and I have been hard at work on
a brand new book for over two years. Ian brings with him a wealth of experience
from using RSpec since 2006. He has a keen ability to translate technical
concepts into easy-to-read, enjoyable books, such as the PragProg titles [Seven
More Languages in Seven
Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks) and
[Cucumber Recipes](https://pragprog.com/book/dhwcr/cucumber-recipes).

I've been the lead maintainer of RSpec since 2012.  I've built many of RSpec's
notable additions in recent years, including composable matchers, the `--bisect`
and `--only-failures` options, and the `:aggregate_failures` features. Together,
we've written a book we're very proud of, and we're happy to announce it is now in beta:

We've written [Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with
Confidence](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3) to
be _the_ definitive guide to modern RSpec. If you're new to RSpec, it's a
perfect introduction. If you've used RSpec before, but haven't kept up with the
recent changes, this book will get you up to speed, covering new features through
the soon-to-released RSpec 3.6.

Our book goes far beyond the RSpec documentation, walking through
building a real-world JSON API and then diving deep into each part
of RSpec. The theme of _effective testing_--using practices to get
more _value_ out of your specs than the cost of writing them--is woven
throughout.
