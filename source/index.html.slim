    h2 Let's get started!

    p
      | To kick things off, install RSpec and run <code>rspec --init</code> to
        set up your project to use RSpec.

    p
      | Start with a very simple example that expresses some basic desired
        behaviour.
    = asciinema_video 14100, speed: 4

    p Run the example and watch it fail.
    = asciinema_video 14101, speed: 2

    p
     | Implement that basic behaviour...
    = asciinema_video 14102, speed: 2

    p Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.
    = asciinema_video 14103, speed: 2

    h3 Take very small steps
    p
      | Don’t rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another example and let
        it guide you to what you have to do next. And don’t forget to take time
        to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep your code
        clean at every step of the way.

      h3 Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with Confidence
      p
        | This definitive guide from RSpec’s lead developer shows you how to use RSpec to drive more maintainable designs, specify and document expected behavior, and prevent regressions during refactoring. Build a project using RSpec to design, describe, and test the behavior of your code-whether you’re new to testing tools or an experienced developer.

      h3 Hands-on Test-Driven Development: Learn Test-Driven Development
      p
        | Learn to properly test Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications by first writing failing tests, and then by implementing application code to make the failing tests pass. This book will teach you how to employ test-driven development (TDD) using RSpec while building a blog from start to finish. By the end of the book, you will be ready to deploy your fully tested blog to your own production web server using the latest versions of Ruby 3 and Ruby on Rails 7.

      p
        | The Testing Ruby Applications with RSpec screencast introduces the core RSpec libraries through the development of a small CLI card game. In addition to covering the technical aspects of using RSpec, it also covers best practices for using them so you get the most out of your test suite: different types of tests, what kinds of things to test, when different styles are appropriate.
